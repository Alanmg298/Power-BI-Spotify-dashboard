# Power-BI-Spotify-dashboard


This is a simple Power BI project where I explored Spotify data to create an interactive dashboard. The goal was to practice data visualization and present insights in a clear and engaging way, combining two things I enjoy: musicðŸŽµ and creating dashboards.

The dashboard lets you:

- See the most-streamed songs per year ðŸŽ¤

- Explore trends by year ðŸ“…

- Discover the most popular songs per region ðŸŽ§

- And sneak a peek at the most viral song till 2020 ðŸ’¥
